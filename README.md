# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. This project demonstrates fundamental HTML skills including structure, links, lists, and images.

## Project Description

This is a basic recipe website that consists of a main index page with links to individual recipe pages. The website showcases three delicious recipes:

- **Lasagna** - A classic Italian comfort food
- **Beef Wellington** - An elegant British dish
- **Baked Ham** - A traditional holiday favorite

## Skills Demonstrated

Through building this project, I have demonstrated proficiency in:

- **HTML Structure**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements and document structure
- **Links and Navigation**: Creating internal links between pages and navigation structure
- **Lists**: Implementation of both ordered and unordered lists for ingredients and steps
- **Images**: Incorporating images to enhance the visual appeal of recipes
- **File Organization**: Organizing project files in a logical directory structure
- **Git Workflow**: Using Git for version control and GitHub for hosting

## Features

- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Responsive navigation between recipe pages
- Detailed recipe pages with:
  - Recipe images
  - Description sections
  - Ingredient lists (unordered lists)
  - Step-by-step instructions (ordered lists)
  - Navigation links back to the home page
- Basic CSS styling for improved presentation
