        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My whole family loves this baked ham that's topped with brown sugar and baked with moist heat. So delicious!</p>
        <p>This holiday-perfect baked ham recipe, made with just four ingredients, will quickly become a tradition in your household.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Ham: </strong>You'll need the rump portion of a bone-in ham. If your ham is larger or smaller than 12 pounds, you'll need to make some adjustments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cloves: </strong> Whole cloves add warmth and a certain depth of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar: </strong> Brown sugar lends more warmth and welcome sweetness.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Water: </strong> Use about an inch of water. This isn't one-size-fits-all, as different roasting pans will need different amounts.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Press cloves into the top of the ham. Pack with brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Add water to the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the ham is done.</li>
        </ol>
